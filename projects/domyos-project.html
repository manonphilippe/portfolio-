  <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>In order to create a range of motor accessories for children, Domyos has set up a team consisting of a product manager, an engineer and a designer to develop new products. Beginning their range with carpets, balls, hoops and tunnels their aim was to create a _motor skills courses_ according to the age of the child and the constraints of home interiors.</p>

<div class="article-paragraph">
  <h3>Opportunity</h3>
    <p>I was in charge of creating a motor skills course for children aged 0 to 6 years old that can be used at home. Being an intern designer during this project, I was not able to finish the development of the product. My work consisted of the analysis of the needs, the motor skills of the child, the concept-product proposals and the phase 1 of the development of the final product.</p>

  <h2>UX Research Plan</h2><br>

<!-- 1bis - ANALYSE
  <div class="h3apresh2">
  <h3>First stage, reach the most people</h3>
  </div>
      <p>Today, adding bank data to an application is no longer trivial. But still many people are suspicious and prefer to enter them manually for each purchase.
      <br>My first goal was to understand what were the different behaviours of users with their phone, their buying habits, if they were using apps dedicated to online payment like PayPal, Pay lib… and on which criteria their trust was based.
      <br>I started by creating a survey to collect as much data as possible. I was able to gather 170 responses from all ages, with a majority of 46–60-year-olds.
      <br>The credit card (67%) and PayPal (25%) are the two most used methods to pay for purchases on the Internet.</p>
</div>

<div class="article-image">
    <img src="/assets/images/essai2.png" class="card-img">
</div>

<div class="article-paragraph">
    <p>I’ve seen that 30% of people avoid entering their bank details on applications. The other 70% accept on commercial sites thanks to their national or international recognition as Amazon, Netflix Private Sales, SNCF, Drive for shopping.</p>
</div>

<div class="article-image">
    <img src="/assets/images/essai2.png" class="card-img">
</div>

<div class="article-paragraph">
    <p>Be famous or recognized for your seriousness.<br>
    Well, GoMyPartner is not yet known nationally (although we are working on it), the next step was to ask about what triggered them to trust these companies or what would be their criteria for them to accept to trust us.</p>
</div>

<div class="user-quote">
      <q>It needs to be intuitive (easy to use and fast), secure (respect of the T&Cs), communicating (visually attractive, between the website, social network pages, external communication…).
      <br><b>Alain, 46 years old.</b></q>
</div>

<div class="article-paragraph">
      <p>So after analysing all the open-ended answers, I was able to create 4 main categories of criteria’s:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The company need to be <b>well noted</b> and offers <b>bank guarantees</b></li>
        <li>The app needs to be <b>as simple as possible</b></li>
        <li>The company needs to provide a <b>complete security process</b> when the user entering their bank details</li>
        <li>We need to create a <b>link between your bank and the app</b> (SMS, security codes…)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And I was also able to understand an important and essential point that was; <b>the application must be useful daily to be able to leave its bank codes.</b></p>
</div>

<!-- 1bis - ANALYSE
<div class="article-paragraph">
  <h3>Second stage, deep on qualitative insights.</h3>
  <p>With these different insights in hand, I decided to go deeper on the information by conducting 5 interviews with GoMyPartner users.
  <br>At first, my goal was to understand their perception of the company (nb: the application was not yet released). Ask them about their online shopping habits and whether they would trust GoMyPartner.</p><br>
  <p><b>What did I conclude?</b></p><br>
  <ul>
    <li>GoMyPartner is a trustworthy company thanks to certain actions such as partnerships with big brands (Cora, Franprix…), the suggestion of reimbursement by check, or the fact that the start-up is promoted by sports clubs.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="user-quote">
      <q>I trust GoMyPartner because they offer well-known brands so it’s a company that has shown guarantees.
      <br><b>Florence, 38 years old.</b></q>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>But a trustworthy company doesn’t mean that users would leave their bank details more easily.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="user-quote">
      <q>For the moment yes, I trust GoMyPartner because there is no money story. I will have more doubts when it concerns money and credit card .
      <br><b>Claude, 72 years old.</b></q>
  </div>
  <p>The second step was to understand each customer’s experience of asking a refund on the GMP platform to find opportunities to highlight the new implementation of the feature.
  <br>I asked the users about how they perceive this experience, how long the action took? What are their frustrations & expectations? Did they have issues during the process? …<br>
  <br>For us, the reimbursement process is easier and faster (from 5 to 10 min maximum), so they didn’t understand the benefit of adding the bank account.</p>

<!-- 2 - MESS APPEARS
<div class="article-paragraph">
  <h3>A mess appears.</h3>
  <p>At the end of my different interviews, I understood that the CEOs were not aligned with the real problems of their users, the users themselves were not aligned with their own frustrations with different expectations.
  <br>But lets me explain you with a User Journey Map to be more visual. I started to create the usual journey of a client when he bought products and ask for a refund.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>At first I highlight the frustrations/design opportunities of the GMP user:</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="article-image">
      <img src="/assets/images/essai2.png" class="card-img">
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Then, I noted that the expectations are not the same than the frustrations when I asked: What do you think GoMyPartner needs to improve in order for you to trust them?</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="article-image">
      <img src="/assets/images/essai2.png" class="card-img">
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>To finish I listed the thoughts of GoMyPartner about their user's frustrations.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- 3 - AHAH MOMENT
<div class="article-paragraph">
  <h3>Make way for my AHA moment.</h3>
  <p>I understood that I don’t have a precise design opportunity to resolve but the global experience of the app to redesign.
  <br>If GoMyPartner wants to implement the new feature and this one is accepted and used, they need to improve the before and after the experience of buying product.<br>
  <br>By adding the different points listed during the quantitative analysis, I will work on the global experience with 4 main points in mind:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Creating a user path as simple as possible.</li>
    <li>Highlighting the company’s reliability.</li>
    <li>Always have a link between the user bank and the app and a complete security process.</li>
    <li>Thinking about how to propose a daily use of the app.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="article-paragraph">
  <p><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b></p>
  <p>How might we built user confidence on the app to when they registered their bank account by improve the clarity and understanding of the app & keep in mind the security criteria?</p>
</div>

<!--4 - START REDESIGNING
<div class="article-paragraph">
  <h3>Start redesigning with the User Flow.</h3>
  <p>To redesign the global experience, I started by tackling the user flow. It allowed me to get an overview of the different features and visualize where I need to focus on.
 <br>On this user flow, the blue boxes are the screens/actions already existing. The orange boxes are the improvement or design that I have to make.</p>

 <div class="article-image">
     <img src="/assets/images/essai2.png" class="card-img">
 </div>

  <p>I decided to focus on 4 parts (the first two to improve and the two others to create)</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The onboarding experience; improve the storytelling, show GMP as a reliable company, insert some security point to enter on the app.</li>
    <li>The pot part; make this part more understandable and easier to understand, highlighting also the benefit of adding the bank details</li>
    <li>Implement the bank details feature by thinking at the overall experience of entering their bank account (link with the bank, security check…)</li>
    <li>Working on the gamification of the app to be able to use the application in another way.</li>

    <h3>1. The Onboarding Experience.</h3>
    </div>
    <p>My first challenge was to redesign the onboarding process. I started with a little audit of the existing screens and list all the points good or bad.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A lack of graphical consistency that does not help in the user’s understanding
      legal</li>
      <li>The “Comment ça marche” CTA is present but the explanations are too vague. As a basic cashback app, the explanations are always too vague and is always difficult to understand how as a user you can win some money.</li>
      <li>Facebook proposed to sign in, something unpleasant if you need to add the banks account later on.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>BE RELIABLE</b><br>
      _Starting with the home page the goal was to highlight the professionalism of the company by adding the logo “Ministère des sports” because of the partnership and the different competitions that they won.<br>

  <h3>2. The Pot Part.</h3>
  <p>The second challenge was to rework the pot part of the app. I had two tasks to work on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Highlight the new feature by adapting and showing the benefit of adding your bank account.</li>
    <li>Improve the clarity of the pots system and make it understandable.<br>As a reminder: GoMyPartner propose two pots, one is for the sports expenditure named Cagnotte Sport and the second one is for the personal purchases named Cagnotte Perso.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="article-paragraph">
  <p><b>_HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFIT OF ADDING YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.</b><br>
  At first, I visually separated the two pots so that there was no misunderstanding between the different possible actions of the two. Then, I created two very distinct displays. The idea was to see which layout was the simplest and most comprehensible for the user.
  <br>The first screen highlighted the different payment option (check, bank transfer, credit card…) before choosing the action (payment, refund, gift card) that with wanted to do.
  <br>The second was the opposite, propose to the user the different actions (payment, refund, gift card) that he can do and after the payment option (check, bank transfer, credit card…).<br>
  <br>I conduct a A/B testing with 6 users and the second was the most chosen (action before payment option).</p>
  <div class="article-image">

<div class="article-paragraph">
  <p><b>_KEEP IT SIMPLE & UNDERSTANDABLE.</b><br>
  Once the pots homepage was done, I start to rework on the information architecture for the other ones.Then I worked on the wording which was not clear enough and confusing.
  <br>Adding the delay of refund for each payment method helps to complete one expectation of users: “One month delay for the refund is too long.” by showing a short delay (3 days) after adding his bank details.
  <br>Then, we decided to create a help page for users and simplify the refunding history.</p>

  <h3>3. Implement the new feature: Register your bank account.</h3>
  <p>Let’s deep into the design of the new feature, for this part I started from scratch.
  <br>Remembering the different criteria I may have had during my analysis phase I was able to divide this experience into three phases.</p>


  <div class="user-quote">
      <q>A symbol to prove the security of the application 2- A security code at the time of purchase 3- An emergency number in case of problem.
      <br><b>Henri, 40 years old.</b></q>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="article-paragraph">
  <p><b>BEFORE: Guiding the user around security & advantages.</b><br>
  The user needs to be reassured and guided to understand what are the benefits of adding his bank account on the app.</p>

<div class="user-quote">
  <q>I need to know what the advantages are if I add my bank account. If it’s just for the automatic reimbursements I’m not interested.
  <br><b>Oliver, 53 years old.</b></q>
</div>

  <p>I started my analyse with short market research on the different cashback and money transfer app to understand how they give confidence to the user, what are their explanation about security and how they display them.
  <br>During some tests with the different templates of the security page, one of the users told me an interesting insight.</p>

  <div class="user-quote">
    <q>It’s not complicated sentences with specific bank terms that give confidence to the user.
    <br><b>Oliver, 53 years old.</b></q>
  </div>

  <p>I started to keep it simple, understandable and delete the interminable paragraphs that users do not take the time to read.
  <br>Moving on the advantage page, I started to list them by taking the time to highlight the two main expectations of GMP users:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>More partner shop</li>
    <li>Faster refund after using your pot</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="article-image">
      <img src="/assets/images/essai2.png" class="card-img">
  </div>
</div>


<div class="article-paragraph">
  <p><b>DURING: Create a secure platform.</b><br>
  About this part of the experience, a template of La Banque de France is mandatory to use when the user enters the bank account.
  <br>I didn’t have a big thing to do. I was however able to work on the colours of the CTAs and details of the pages according to the bank chosen to remind the link between them. And the addition of a validation SMS at the end of the transaction.</p>

  <div class="user-quote">
    <q>I need to see security with bank affiliation, sms validation code, confirmation email with receipt in the user’s language.

</div>

<div class="article-paragraph">
  <p><b>AFTER: Leave the control to the user.</b><br>
  The after-experience is also the most important part. During my interviews, I understand that the users want to be free to manage their data and have the possibility to contact someone in case of a problem.</p>

  <div class="user-quote">
    <q>I would like to be able to manage my bank details myself, like deleting them. If my phone gets stolen, how do I do that?
    <br><b>Véronique, 53 years old.</b></q>
  </div>

  <p>I also learned during a short test that showing too much security option give the feeling that something “must be fishy”.
  <br>As the security page, I decided to keep it clear the information that I need to convey.</p>

  <h3>4. Gamification aspect of the app.</h3>
  <p>The last part of my project consisting of creating a new usage of this app, and not just register the shopping bill and ask for a refund.<br>
<br>We want to attract the users and create this app as a daily basis and one of the expectations of the company was to broaden the type of users, reaching young people.
<br>I decided to propose different challenges to the users to complete. More the user complete challenges more he levels up and can win some money, gift card or have more refund. Always with the sport thematic for sure. <br>
<br>This part allowed GoMyPartner to gain visibility in the community (challenges to be shared with family and friends) but also to reach out to younger people and propose another usage of the app.</p>

<!-- CONCLUSION
<div class="article-paragraph">
  <div class="h3apresh2">
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
</div>
  <p>It was a big achievement to finish this project in two weeks.<br>
<br>GoMyPartner started implementing the improvements of the different parts of the app as the pots part and the onboarding experience.
<br>The principle of the pot system is always a bit fuzzy for the users because now we have a lack of developing the side of the sports club projects.<br>
<br>The new feature of adding their bank account was implemented on the 10th of December 2020. Today there are more than …. people who already enter their data.
<br>For my point of view, the gamification part lacks work and tests to come up with something solid, but it’s improving!<br>
<br>Today, by looking at the application, you can see the different updates due to the lack of consistency. It would be essential to update the Style Guide and do some background work on the existing app to bring everything up to standard (button, illustrations, toggles, cards, icons…).</p>
<br>
<p><b>What did I learn about the industry, the users & the topic?</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Create my own UX Process</li>
  <li>Iterate and improve an existing application</li>
  <li>Work on the security and banking side of an application.</li>
</ul>
